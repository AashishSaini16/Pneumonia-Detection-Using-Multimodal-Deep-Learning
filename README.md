# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Multimodal-Deep-Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for developing a multimodal deep learning model to detect pneumonia using chest X-ray images and patient symptoms. The project leverages a Kaggle dataset for images and synthetic symptom text data, demonstrating preprocessing, model training, and prediction capabilities.
